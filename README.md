Wi-Fi CSI Edge AI Spatial Monitoring System

An end-to-end, privacy-preserving edge-IoT monitoring system that detects human presence and motion states (standing vs. walking) using standard Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI), deployed on bare-metal microcontrollers and visualized through an immersive Three.js 3D cinematic web dashboard.

Architecture & System Pipeline

Plaintext

[ESP32: CSI Sensing & TinyML Inference] --(Serial/UART)--> [Python Flask-SocketIO Server]
[ESP8266: RSSI Triangulation Node]       --(UDP Broadcast)--> [Socket.io Real-Time Stream] ---> [Three.js 3D Dashboard]
ESP32 (Primary Node): Captures raw physical Wi-Fi CSI amplitudes, performs real-time digital signal processing (DSP) feature extraction (mean, max, and variance differences), and runs hardware-level TinyML inference using a compiled Random Forest model.

ESP8266 (Secondary Node): Tracks RSSI spatial telemetry and broadcasts positional packets over UDP.

Python Backend:
An asynchronous Flask-SocketIO bridge that aggregates serial streams and UDP packets, applies rolling-window smoothing, and broadcasts real-time telemetry.

Frontend Dashboard:
A high-tech web interface built with Three.js featuring volumetric lighting, a dynamic grid, and a real-time GLTF animated avatar (avatar.glb) that mirrors user positioning and skeletal animations.
